# Bayesian zero-inflated spatio-temporal modelling of scrub typhus data in Korea, 2010-2014

Abstract
Scrub typhus, a bacterial, febrile disease commonly occurring
in the autumn, can easily be cured if diagnosed early. However, it
can develop serious complications and even lead to death. For this
reason, it is an important issue to find the risk factors and thus be
able to prevent outbreaks. We analyzed the monthly scrub typhus
data over the entire areas of South Korea from 2010 through 2014.
A 2-stage hierarchical framework was considered since weather
data are covariates and the scrub typhus data have different spatial
resolutions. At the first stage, we obtained the administrative-level
estimates for weather data using a spatial model; in the second, we
applied a Bayesian zero-inflated spatio-temporal model since the
scrub typhus data include excess zero counts. We found that the
zero-inflated model considering the spatio-temporal interaction
terms improves fitting and prediction performance. This study
found that low humidity and a high proportion of elderly people
are significantly associated with scrub typhus incidence.
